            INTRODUCTION
        </div>

            <p>
                <u>IN MY CAREER</u> as a reader I have encountered only three people who knew The Long Ships, and all of them, like me, loved
                it immoderately. Four for four: from this tiny but irrefutable sample I dare to extrapolate that this novel, first
                published in Sweden during the Second World War, stands ready, given the chance, to bring lasting pleasure to every
                single human being on the face of the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The record of a series of three imaginary but plausible voyages (inter rupted by a singularly eventful interlude of
                hanging around the house) undertaken by a crafty, resourceful, unsentimental, and mildly hypochondriacal Norseman named
                “Red Orm” Tosteson, The Long Ships is itself a kind of novelistic Argos aboard which, like the heroes of a great age,
                all the strategies deployed by European novelists over the course of the preceding century are united—if not for the
                first, then perhaps for the very last time. The Dioscuri of nineteenth-century realism, factual precision and mundane
                detail, set sail on The Long Ships with nationalism, medievalism, and exoticism for shipmates, brandishing a banner of
                nineteenth-century romance; but among the heroic crew mustered by Frans Bengtsson in his only work of fiction is an
                irony as harsh and forgiving as anything in Dickens, a wit and skepticism worthy of Stendhal, an epic Tolstoyan sense of
                the anti-epic, and the Herculean narrative drive, mighty and nimble, of Alexandre Dumas. Like half the great European
                novels, The Long Ships is big, bloody, and far-ranging, concerned with war and treasure and the grand deeds of men and
                kings; like the other half, it is intimate and domestic, centered firmly around the seasons and pursuits of village and
                farm, around weddings and births, around the hearths of women who see only too keenly through the grand pretensions of
                men and bloody kings.
            </p>
            <p>
                The book offers, therefore—as you might expect from a novel with the potential to please every literate human being in
                the entire world—something for everyone, and if until now The Long Ships has languished in the secondhand bins of the
                English-speaking world, this is certainly through no fault of its author, Frans Bengtsson, whom the reader comes to
                regard—as we come to regard any reliable, capable, and congenial companion in the course of any great novel, adventure,
                or novel of adventure—as a friend for life. Bengtsson re-creates the world of 1000 AD, as seen through the eyes of some
                of its northernmost residents, with telling detail and persuasive historiography, with a long view of human vanity, and
                with the unflagging verve of a born storyteller—but above all, and this is the most remarkable of the book’s many
                virtues, with an intimate detachment, a neighborly distance, a sincere irony, that feels at once ancient and postmodern.
                It is this astringent tone, undeceived, versed in folly, at once charitable and cruel, that is the source of the novel’s
                unique flavor, the poker-faced humor that is most beloved by those who love this book. Though at times the story,
                published in two parts each consisting of two parts over a span of several years, has an episodic feel, each of its
                individual components' narratives is well constructed of the soundest timbers of epic, folktale and ripping yarn, and as
                its hero grows old and sees his age passing away, that episodic quality comes to feel, in the end, not like some
                congeries of saga and tall tale but like the accurate representation of one long and crowded human life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nor can blame for the neglect of The Long Ships be laid at the feet of Bengtsson’s English translator, Michael Meyer,
                who produced a version of the original the faithfulness of which I leave for the judgment of others but whose utter
                deliciousness, as English, I readily proclaim. The antique chiming that stirs the air of the novel’s sentences (without
                ever overpowering or choking that air with antique dust) recalls the epics and chronicles and history our mother tongue
                (a history after all shared, up to a point, with the original Swedish), and the setting of parts of the action in Dark
                Ages Britain further strengthens the reader’s deceptive sense that he or she is, thanks to the translator’s magic and
                art, reading a work of English literature. Toss in the novel’s unceasing playfulness around the subject of Christianity
                and its relative virtues and shortcomings when compared to Islam and, especially, to the old religion of the northern
                forests (a playfulness that cannot disguise the author’s profound but lightly worn concern with questions of ethics and
                the right use and purpose of a life), and the startling presence, in a Swedish Viking story, of a sympathetic Jewish
                character, and you have a work whose virtues and surprises ought long since to have given it a prominent place at least
                in the pantheon of the world’s adventure literature if not world literature full stop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fault, therefore, must lie with the world, which, as any reader of The Long Ships could tell you, buries its
                treasures, despises its glories, and seeks contentment most readily in the places where it is least likely to be found.
                My encounter with The Long Ships came when I was fourteen or fifteen, through the agency of a true adventurer, my
                mother’s sister, Gail Cohen. Toward the end of the sixties she had set off, with the rest of her restless generation of
                psychic Vikings, on a journey that led from suburban Maryland, to California where she met and fell in love with a
                roving young Dane, to Denmark itself, where she settled and lived for twenty years. It was on one of her periodic visits
                home that she handed me a U.K. paperback edition of the book, published by Fontana, which she had randomly purchased at
                the airport in Copenhagen, partly because it was set in her adopted homeland and partly because there was nothing on the
                rack that looked any better. “It’s really good,” she assured me, and I would soon discover for myself the truth of this
                assessment, which in turn I would repeat to other lucky people over the years to come. Gail’s own adventure came to an
                end at home, in America, in the toils of cancer. When she looked back at the map of it, like most true adventurers, she
                saw moments of joy, glints of gold, and happy chances like the one that brought this book into her hands. But I fear
                that like most true adventurers—and unlike Bengtsson’s congenitally fortunate hero—she also saw, looking back, that
                grief overtopped joy, that trash obscured the treasure, that, in the end, the bad luck outweighed the good.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is the great advantage, of course, that reading holds over what we call “real life.” Adventure is a dish that is
                best eaten takeout, in the comfort of one’s own home. As you begin your meal, as you set off with Frans Bengtsson and
                Red Orm and the restless spirit of my aunt, I salute you, and bid you farewell, and even though I have just finished
                reading the book for the fourth time, I envy you the pleasure you are about to find in the pages of The Long Ships. When
                you arrive at its bittersweet, but mostly sweet, conclusion, I trust that you will turn to your shipmate, your companion
                in adventure, and swear by ancient oaths, as I hereby swear to you: It is really good.

            <u>HOW THE SHAVEN MEN FARED IN SKANIA IN KING HARALD BLUETOOTH’S TIME</u>

            <p>
                Many restless men rowed north from Skania with Bue and Vagn, and found ill fortune at Jörundfjord; others marched with
                Styrbjörn to Uppsala and died there with him. When the news reached their homeland that few of them could be expected to
                return, elegies were declaimed and memorial stones set up; where-upon all sensible men agreed that what had happened was
                for the best, for they could now hope to have a more peaceful time than before, and less parceling out of land by the ax
                and sword. There followed a time of plenty, with fine rye harvests and great herring catches, so that most people were
                well contented; but there were some who thought that the crops were tardy, and they went a-viking in Ireland and
                England, where fortune smiled on their wars; and many of them stayed there.
            </p>
            <p>
                About this time the shaven men had begun to arrive in Skania, both from the Saxons' land and from England, to preach the
                Christian faith. They had many strange tales to relate, and at first people were curious and listened to them eagerly,
                and women found it pleasant to be baptized by these foreigners and to be presented with a white shift. Before long,
                however, the foreigners began to run short of shifts, and people wearied of their sermons, finding them tedious and
                their matter doubtful; besides which, they spoke a rough-sounding dialect that they had learned in Hedeby or in the
                western islands, which gave their speech a foolish air.
            </p>
            <p>
                So then there was something of a decline in conversions, and the shaven men, who talked incessantly of peace and were
                above all very violent in their denunciation of the gods, were one by one seized by devout persons and were hung up on
                sacred ash trees and shot at with arrows, and offered to the birds of Odin. Others went northwards to the forests of the
                Göings, where men were less religiously inclined; there they were welcomed warmly, and were tied up and led to the
                markets in Smaland, where they were bartered for oxen and for beaver skins. Some of them, upon finding themselves slaves
                of the Smalanders, let their hair grow and waxed discontented with their God Jehovah and gave good service to their
                masters; but the majority continued to denounce the gods and to spend their time baptizing women and children instead of
                breaking stones and grinding corn, and made such a nuisance of themselves that soon it became impossible for the Göings
                to obtain, as hitherto, a yoke of three-year-old oxen for a sturdy priest without giving a measure of salt or cloth into
                the bargain. So feeling increased against the shaven men in the border country.
            </p>
            <p>
                One summer the word went round the whole of the Danish kingdom that King Harald Bluetooth had embraced the new religion.
                In his youth he had done so tentatively, but had soon regretted his decision and recanted; this time, however, he had
                adopted it seriously. For King Harald was by now an old man and had for some years been tormented by terrible pains in
                his back, so that he had almost lost his pleasure in ale and women; but wise bishops, sent by the Emperor himself, had
                rubbed him with bear’s grease, blessed and made potent with the names of apostles, and had wrapped him in sheepskins and
                given him holy herbal water to drink instead of ale, and had made the sign of the cross between his shoulders and
                exorcised many devils out of him, until at last his aches and pains had departed; and so the King became a Christian.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thereupon the holy men had assured him that still worse torments would come to plague him if he should ever again offer
                sacrifice or show himself in any way unzealous in the new religion. So King Harald (as soon as he had become active
                again and found himself capable of fulfilling his obligations toward a young Moroccan slave-girl, whom Olof of the
                Precious Stones, the King of Cork, had sent him as a good-will present) issued a proclamation that all his subjects
                should get themselves christened without delay; and although such an order sounded strangely from the lips of one who
                was himself descended from Odin, still, many obeyed his command, for he had ruled long and prosperously, so that his
                word counted for much in the land. He meted out especially severe punishments to anyone who had been guilty of violence
                against any priest; so that the number of priests in Skania now began to multiply greatly, and churches rose upon the
                plain, and the old gods fell into disuse, except in times of peril at sea or of cattle plague.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Göinge, however, the King’s proclamation was the occasion of much merriment. The people of the border forests were
                blessed with a readier sense of fun than the sober dwellers of the plain, and nothing made them laugh so much as a royal
                proclamation. For in the border country few men’s authority extended beyond the limit of their right arm, and from
                Jellinge to Göinge was a long march even for the mightiest of kings to undertake. In the old days, in the time of Harald
                Hildetand and Ivar of the Broad Embrace, and even before that, kings had been wont to come to Göinge to hunt the wild ox
                in the great forests there, but seldom on any other errand. But since those times the wild ox had died out, and the
                kings' visits had ceased; so that nowadays, if any king was bold enough to murmur a complaint that the people of those
                parts were turbulent or that they paid insufficient taxes, and threatened to journey thither himself to remedy matters,
                the answer would be sent to him that there were, unfortunately, no wild oxen to be seen in the district nowadays, but
                that as soon as any should appear he would at once be informed and a royal welcome would be prepared for him.
                Accordingly, it had for long been a saying among the border people that no king would be seen in their country until the
                wild oxen returned.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in Göinge things remained as they had always been, and Christianity made no headway there. Such priests as did
                venture into those parts were sold over the border as in the old days; though some of the Göings were of the opinion
                that it would be better to kill them on the spot and start a good war against the skinflints of Sunnerbo and Allbo, for
                the Smalanders gave such poor prices for priests nowadays that it was hardly worth a man’s trouble to lead them to
                market.
