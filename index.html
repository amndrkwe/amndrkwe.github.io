                oh hey,
            </h1>

            <h2>
                im amndrkwe / andre you can call me whatever
            </h2>
            
                <p>
                    my favorite language is c++, 
                    my favorite mushroom is the campanella junghuhnii,
                    im from brazil, rio de janeiro, my home.
                    people call me annoying sometimes, 
                    my favorite dinossaur is the amargasaurus
                </p>

                <p>
                    here's a drawing of them:

                    <img src="images/amargasaurus.png", alt="they're neat">

                    they're cool
                </p>

                <p>
                    i also code sometimes and i have a couple of projects on the works,
                    one is a cool place to store books in a good, readable and beautiful form.
                    aesthetics is everything really, no one truly cares about books
                </p>

                <p> 
                    at the moment im just transcribing those books by hand, 
                    if someone can help me with getting a decently good
                    conversion algorithm from pdf to txt or even to html i can draw you a 
                    dinossaur of your own choosing, poorly
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="books/"> 
                    here's an obnoxiously long and overtly convoluted hyperlink, 
                    it will take you to the library thing project? currently it's called 
                    amndrkwe's file emporium. but im not really selling anything? maybe i
                    should change it in some way. maybe not the name
                    has quite a ring to it.
                    </a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    i hate webdesign, the less time i can work on this the
                    better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    this is why this website looks horrible. i will not and cannot
                    improve on this further. this is the best it will get.
